# JustOpine

JustOpine is a tool to get students talking about current events. Through the platform, teachers are able to assign opinion pieces for students to respond to and discuss.

The tech team for this project is based at [Founders & Coders London](www.foundersandcoders.com).

## Tech Stack

This project is being built in full stack JavaScript, using Node.js and Hapi.js on the backend. SASS is being used on the frontend. We're using Redis as our database. Testing tools include Lab, Code and Tape.

## Current Status

JustOpine 1.0 is due for release soon. The Node backend has been built, Redis integrated as the database, and the front-end fully built out in SASS. The team is just working through some final additions to the MVP.
