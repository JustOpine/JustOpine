# JustOpine

JustOpine is a tool to get students talking about current events. Through the platform, teachers are able to assign opinion pieces for students to respond to and discuss.

This project is being completed at [Founders & Coders London](www.foundersandcoders.com).

## Tech Stack

This project is being built in full stack JavaScript, using Node.js and Hapi.js on the backend. SASS is being used on the frontend. We're using Redis as our database for maximum efficiency. Testing tools include Shot and QUnit.

## Current Status

The product is still in development, with the MVP due to be completed by the end of the first week of August.

As of 30 July:
* Wireframes have been completed and user stories written (see https://github.com/foundersandcoders/JustOpine/issues/16)
* Server has been built with Hapi
* Redis database has been initialised (methods still to be written)
* Basic HTML structures have been completed
* SASS folder structure has been set up
* Some pages have been styled with dummy CSS: landing page
* Preliminary routes have been written and fully tested
