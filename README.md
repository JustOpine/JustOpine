# JustOpine

JustOpine is a tool to get students talking about current events. Through the platform, teachers are able to assign opinion pieces for students to respond to and discuss.

This project is being completed at [Founders & Coders London](www.foundersandcoders.com).

## Tech Stack

This project is being built in full stack JavaScript, using Node.js and Hapi.js on the backend. SASS is being used on the frontend. We're using Redis as our database for maximum efficiency. Testing tools include Lab, Code and Tape.

## Current Status

The product is still in development, with the MVP due to be completed by the end of the first week of August.

As of 2 August 2015:
* Wireframes have been completed and user stories written (see https://github.com/foundersandcoders/JustOpine/issues/16)
* Server has been built with Hapi
* Redis database has been initialised, with methods in progress
* Redis tests are in progress (thus the red Travis badge)
* Basic HTML structures have been completed
* SASS folder structure has been set up
* All views have basic styling, with landing page and discu
* Preliminary routes have been written and fully tested
