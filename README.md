# JustOpine

JustOpine is a tool to get students talking about current events. Through the platform, teachers are able to assign opinion pieces for students to respond to and discuss.

This project is being completed at [Founders & Coders London](www.foundersandcoders.com).

## Tech Stack

This project is being built in full stack JavaScript, using Node.js and Hapi.js on the backend. SASS is being used on the frontend. We're using Redis as our database for maximum efficiency. Testing tools include Lab, Code and Tape.

## Current Status

Project is still in development, with MVP due for release soon. Database has been built in Redis, front-end fully built out in SASS, and we're just grappling with some final data display issues and testing on the backend.
